# Projectile-
An open-source projectile system built for Roblox Studio. ProjectilePlus is an all-in-one projectile system, and by that I mean it includes everything you would want in a projectile system. This includes OOP based projectiles, custom methods for controlling projectile physics, client sided visuals, and more!
